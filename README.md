<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A rising issue observed in the world of academia and research is Predatory Publishing. This refers to the act of journals charging “publication fees” from researchers to publish papers, often those lacking quality to have any real academic relevance. Journals don’t check the legitimacy of the article, and most papers published in these journals are just derivatives of other works (plagiarism).
No transparent peer-review process, even if the journal claims to do one. How do we trust if first reviews were conducted, and second, were they conducted by qualified peers? Journals are controlled by central authorities with financial motives, there is a lot of corruption. Preference is given to people willing to pay a higher sum of money.
